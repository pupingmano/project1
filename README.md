Introduction to Software Development - Project 1

The purpose of my first projec is to build a website for my existing business, which is to provide digital marketing services across different platforms.
Starting with the company profile - which is yet to be added, then the brief detail of each online channel. The final piece that will be added on this is the portfolio of the work we have done in the past.
So far, I have added jumbotron and nav bar on the first page of the site.
The previous works and acheivements will continue to be added in a form of carousel under portfolio section - to make it easy for audience to navigate.
While the individual section of each channel will be presented differently, using different sets of bootstrap tools.
